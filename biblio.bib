Our proposed RI performs the interpolation in a ï¿½residualï¿½ domain, where the residuals are differences between observed and tentatively estimated pixel values. Our hypothesis for the RI is that if image interpolation is performed in a domain with a smaller Laplacian energy, its accuracy is improved. Based on the hypothesis, we estimate the tentative pixel values to minimize the Laplacian energy of the residuals. We incorporate the RI into the gradient based threshold free (GBTF) algorithm, which is one of the state-of-the-art Bayer demosaicking algorithms.

Full-color image quality strongly depends on the performance of the demosaicking. Here, we propose a CFA raw data denoising algorithm. In the proposed algorithm, the CFA raw data is converted to a pseudo four-channel image by rearranging pixels. Then, the four-channel data are transformed based on the principal component analysis (PCA). Existing high-performance gray image denoising algorithm is applied to each transformed image. Finally, the denoised data is rearranged to obtain denoised CFA raw data. We evaluate both the denoised CFA raw data as well as the full-color image reconstructed with the noisy CFA raw data. Experimental comparisons demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms.}

  abstract =     {Most common cameras use a CCD sensor device measuring a single color per pixel. De- mosaicking is the interpolation process by which one can infer a full color image from such a matrix of values, thus interpolating the two missing components per pixel. Most demosaicking methods take advantage of inter-channel correlation locally selecting the best interpolation di- rection. The obtained results look convincing except when local geometry cannot be inferred from neighboring pixels or channel correlation is low. In these cases, these algorithms create interpolation artifacts such as zipper effect or color aliasing. This paper discusses the implemen- tation details of the algorithm proposed in [J. Duran, A. Buades, â€œSelf-Similarity and Spectral Correlation Adaptive Algorithm for Color Demosaickingâ€, IEEE Trans. Image Process., 23(9), pp. 4031â€“4040, 2014]. The proposed method involves nonlocal image self-similarity in order to reduce interpolation artifacts when local geometry is ambiguous. It further introduces a clear and intuitive manner of balancing how much channel-correlation must be taken advantage of.}

In this paper we present the CFA with new optimal properties which provide trade-off between robustness to aliasing, chrominance noise and luminance noise. The proposed CFA has a natural and simple demosaicking algorithm associated to it, inspired by its characteristics in the Fourier domain. The demosaicking algorithm used is simple and efficient which fully exploits the spectral properties of the CFA. The proposed CFA work superiorly for acquisition of noiseless and noisy images and has six colours and a periodic pattern of size 2*3. A sensor with the proposed CFA will provide images with higher perceived resolution because the anti-alias filter can be removed from the sensor and better quality than the standard Bayer CFA. It is less sensitive to Inter-chrominance aliasing \& chrominance axis. The proposed CFA developed will provide less amplified chrominance noise than Hirakawa CFA. The proposed CFA is developed which will provide robustness in aliasing and luminance \& chrominance noise.}

A single image sensor overlaid with a color filter array (CFA) that filters color channels only captures one color channel at each pixel; thus, the other missing color channels at each pixel must be reproduced from neighboring pixels. This procedure is known as CFA interpolation or demosaicking. In this paper, a novel CFA interpolation method is proposed to reduce false color artifacts and improve the quality of restored images. First, an edge detection method is used to interpolate the initial missing color channels. Second, the high correlations between wavelet subbands of the different color channels are explored to obtain accurate color values of the estimated green channel. Finally, the high-frequency subbands of red and blue channels are iteratively updated to reduce false color artifacts.

However, it was tested only on grayscale images. To study its performance on color images, we have to reconstruct regular color images from Penrose raw images, i.e., images with only one color component at each Penrose pixel, resulting in the problem of demosaicking from Penrose pixels. Penrose demosaicking is more difficult than regular demosaicking, because none of the color components of the reconstructed regular color images are available. Therefore, most of the traditional demosaicking methods do not apply. We develop a sparse representation-based method for Penrose demosaicking. Extensive experiments show that Penrose pixel layout outperforms regular pixel layouts in terms of both perceptual evaluation and S-CIELAB. The Penrose pixel layout is unique among all irregular layouts because it is uniformly three-colorable and it has only two pixel shapes, thick and thin rhombi, making its manufacturing relatively easy.},

The recently published joint demosaicking and zooming algorithms for single-sensor digital cameras all overfit the popular Kodak test images, which have been found to have higher spectral correlation than typical color images. Their performance perhaps significantly degrades on other datasets, such as the McMaster test images, which have weak spectral correlation. A new joint demosaicking and zooming algorithm is proposed for the Bayer color filter array (CFA) pattern, in which the edge direction information (edge map) extracted from the raw CFA data is consistently used in demosaicking and zooming. It also moderately utilizes the spectral correlation between color planes. The experimental results confirm that the proposed algorithm produces an excellent performance on both the Kodak and McMaster datasets in terms of both subjective and objective measures. Our algorithm also has high computational efficiency. It provides a better tradeoff among adaptability, performance, and computational cost compared to the existing algorithms.}

Almost all of the recent approaches identified, with respect to the demosaicking step in the imaging pipeline, have chiefly focused on misguidance problems. However, in regions consisting of sharp edges or fine textures, these approaches are prone to large blurring effects. This paper proposes a new joint solution to overcome the above problems associated with demosaicking and zooming operations. On the basis of an enhanced soft-decision framework, we estimate the edge features by computing the integrated gradients. This allows the extraction of gradient information from both color intensity and color difference domains, simultaneously. Then, the edge guidance is incorporated in the interpolation of various stages to preserve edge consistency and improve computational efficiency. In addition, an edge-adaptive, iterative, back-projection technique is developed to compensate for image blurring as well as to further suppress color artifacts. Experimental results indicate that the new algorithm produces outstanding objective performances and sharp, visually pleasing color outputs, when compared to numerous other single-sensor image zooming solutions.},

  abstract =     {Image demosaicking or color filter array interpolation is a process of interpolating missing color samples to reconstruct a full color image. In general, existing algorithms assume that the high frequency components such as edges, texture etc. of different color channels are similar and thus take an advantage of it to estimate the missing samples. In this paper, we efficiently analyze the relationships of intra and inter-color correlation among the channels and observe that such assumption fails in most cases. In view of this observation, we propose a scheme that exploits the correlation between different color channels much effectively than the existing algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing methods both in terms of Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and visual perception.}

The other two color values of each pixel must be interpolated from the neighboring pixels in the so-called demosaicking process. State-of-the-art demosaicking algorithms take advantage of inter-channel correlation locally selecting the best interpolation direction. These methods give impressive results except when local geometry cannot be inferred from neighboring pixels or channel correlation is low. In these cases, they create interpolation artifacts. We introduce a new algorithm involving non-local image self-similarity in order to reduce interpolation artifacts when local geometry is ambiguous. The proposed algorithm introduces a clear and intuitive manner of balancing how much channel-correlation must be taken advantage of. Comparison shows that the proposed algorithm gives state-of-the-art methods in several image bases.}

We illustrate the properties of this cost functional by several examples in denoising and demosaicking of RGB color images.

This technique additionally reduces the amount of energy required in terms of fuel. Although research activities have increased in this field, high camera prices reflect low adaptation to applications in all fields of agriculture. Smart, low-cost cameras adapted for agricultural applications can overcome this drawback. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for each image pixel is an applicable algorithm to discriminate plant information from the soil background enabled by a large difference in the reflectance between the near infrared (NIR) and the red channel optical frequency band. Two aligned charge coupled device (CCD) chips for the red and NIR channel are typically used, but they are expensive because of the precise optical alignment required. Therefore, much attention has been given to the development of alternative camera designs. In this study, the advantage of a smart one-chip camera design with NDVI image performance is demonstrated in terms of low cost and simplified design. The required assembly and pixel modifications are described, and new algorithms for establishing an enhanced NDVI image quality for data processing are discussed.},

Pour combiner les estimations directionnelles (H et V) des diffï¿½rences de composantes, il est intï¿½ressant de se baser sur les "gradients" de ces diffï¿½rences [pekkucuksen_icip_2010]. Les auteurs utilisent le ratio des sommes des valeurs absolues des gradients H et V des diffï¿½rences de composantes dans un voisinage.
I. Principes de base :
1. Calcul des estimations H et V du R (lig|col R-G-R) ou du B (lig|col G-B-G) en G et inversement [H\&A] -> 1 vraie valeur et 2 estimations directionnelles en chaque pixel.
2. Leur diffï¿½rence fournit 2 cartes ($\Delta^H$ et $\Delta^V$) des estimations des diffï¿½rences de composantes(G-R et G-B) directionnelles.
3. Les diffï¿½rences absolues ("gradients" $D^H$ et $D^V$) des diffï¿½rences de composantes sont utilisï¿½es pour dï¿½terminer un poids pour chaque direction dans une fenï¿½tre 5x5. Ce poids est d'autant plus faible que la somme des valeurs absolues des gradients H et V des diffï¿½rences de composantes est ï¿½levï¿½e.
II. Algo :
1. Estimation initiale du plan G
2. Mise ï¿½ jour du plan G en mettant ï¿½ jour les estimations initiales des diffï¿½rences de composantes en pondï¿½rant chacun des 4 ppV.
3. Calcul des plans R et B, en complï¿½tant d'abord les niveaux manquants diagonaux (par le filtre 7x7 de Paliy), puis les autres en rï¿½utilisant les poids directionnels utilisï¿½s pour le plan G.},

To produce a color image, the two missing color components have to be estimated at each pixel of the corresponding CFA image. This process is commonly referred to as demosaicing, and its result as the demosaiced color image.
Since demosaicing methods intend to produce ï¿½perceptually satisfyingï¿½ demosaiced color images, they attempt to avoid color artifacts. Because this is often achieved by filtering, demosaicing schemes tend to alter the local texture information that is, however, useful to discriminate texture images. To avoid this issue while exploiting color information for texture classification, it may be relevant to compute texture descriptors directly from CFA images.
From chromatic co-occurrence matrices (CCMs) that capture the spatial interaction between color components, we derive new descriptors (CFA CCMs) for CFA texture images. Color textures are then compared by means of the similarity between their CFA CCMs. Experimental results achieved on benchmark color texture databases show the efficiency of this approach for texture classification.},

The major contributions of this work include: (1) The combination of \{LMMSE\} and statistical calculation in wavelet domain are utilized to suppress the signal-dependent noise, which is separated into additive noise and multiplicative noise.

We show that demosaicing is detrimental to the textural information because it affects colour texture descriptors such as Chromatic Co-occurrence Matrices (CCMs). However, it remains desirable to take advantage of the chromatic information for colour texture classification. This information is incompletely defined in CFA images, in which each pixel is associated to one single colour component. It is hence a challenge to extract standard colour texture descriptors from CFA images without demosaicing.

We propose to form a pair of quarter-size colour images directly from CFA images without any estimation, then to compute the CCMs of these quarter-size images. This allows us to compare textures by means of their CCM-based similarity in texture classification or retrieval schemes, with still the ability to use different colour spaces. Experimental results achieved on benchmark colour texture databases show the effectiveness of the proposed approach for texture classification, and a complexity study highlights its computational efficiency.},

Graph-based segmentation greedily clusters the exposure set into regions of roughly constant radiance in order to regularize the OECF estimation. The segmentation works on Gaussian-blurred sensor images, whereby the articial gray value edges caused by the Bayer pattern are smoothed away. With the OECF known the 32-bit HDR radiance map is reconstructed by weighted summation from the dierently exposed raw sensor images. Because the radiance map contains lower sensor noise than the individual images, it is nally demosaiced by weighted bilinear interpolation which prevents the interpolation across edges. Here, the previous segmentation results from the photometric calibration are utilized. After demosaicing, tone mapping is applied, whereby remaining interpolation artifacts are further damped due to the coarser tonal quantization of the resulting image.}

Instead of using monochrome particles the novelty over the prior state of the art is the use of differently dyed tracer particles and the identification of particle color classes directly on Bayer raw images. Especially in the case of a three camera setup it will be shown that the number of ambiguities is dramatically decreased when searching for homologous points in different images. This refers particularly to the determination of spatial parti- cle positions and possibly to the linking of positions into trajectories. The approach allows the handling of tracer parti- cles in high numbers and is therefore perfectly suited for gas flow investigations. Although the idea is simple, difficult- ties may arise particularly in determining the color class of individual particle when its projection on a Bayer sensor is too small. Hence, it is not recommended to extract features from RGB images for color class recognition due to infor- mation loss during the Bayer demosaicing process. This article demonstrates how to classify the color of small sized tracers directly on Bayer raw images.}

  abstract =     {Modern Color Filter Array (CFA) designs avoid overlap of luminance and chrominance spectra as it is widely believed to cause irreversible crosstalk and aliasing. In this paper, we present a simple formulation of the demosaicking problem that disregards spectral overlap - and thus the geometry of the spectra - and instead connects the luminance and chrominance resolutions in a more fundamental way to the photosite density of the sensor. A linear universal demosaicker consisting of space variant filters results from this formulation along with CFA designs that capture more image information than competing designs. This includes the interesting class of random RGB designs that outperform the Bayer CFA with nonlinear demosaickers in terms of PSNR and have a number of additional desirable properties. Furthermore, we present non-linear enhancements to our universal demosaicker and show them to be either related to compressive sensing or an alternate reconstruction algorithm for it.}

  abstract =     {A color filter array (CFA) used in a digital camera is a mosaic of spectrally selective filters, which allows only one color component to be sensed at each pixel. The missing two components of each pixel have to be estimated by methods known as demosaicking. The demosaicking algorithm and the CFA design are crucial for the quality of the output images. In this paper, we present a CFA design methodology in the frequency domain. The frequency structure, which is shown to be just the symbolic DFT of the CFA pattern (one period of the CFA), is introduced to represent images sampled with any rectangular CFAs in the frequency domain. Based on the frequency structure, the CFA design involves the solution of a constrained optimization problem that aims at minimizing the demosaicking error. To decrease the number of parameters and speed up the parameter searching, the optimization problem is reformulated as the selection of geometric points on the boundary of a convex polygon or the surface of a convex polyhedron. Using our methodology, several new CFA patterns are found, which outperform the currently commercialized and published ones. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our CFA design methodology and the superiority of our new CFA patterns.},

Given the demosaicing and zooming methods, a residual image between the â€˜genuineâ€™ image and an initial demosaiced and zoomed image is reconstructed using a dictionary and sparse coding. The â€˜genuineâ€™ image has richer edges and details than that of the initially obtained image. A generic dictionary is generated by learning a large set of training images and their sparse representations. An adaptive dictionary specific to the input CFA is also learned. Using the adaptive dictionary, an initial residual image is reconstructed, and an optimal scaled version of the residual image is then calculated depending on the input CFA. The optimal scaled residual image is added back to the initially obtained image to get the final result. Experimental results show the performance in terms of PSNR and visual quality.}

Most CDM algorithms assume the existence of high local spectral

images with sharp color transitions and high color saturation, such
an assumption may be invalid and visually unpleasant CDM errors
will occur. In this paper, we exploit the image nonlocal redundancy to
improve the local color reproduction result. First, multiple local directional
estimates of a missing color sample are computed and fused
according to local gradients. Then, nonlocal pixels similar to the estimated
pixel are searched to enhance the local estimate. An adaptive
thresholding method rather than the commonly used nonlocal means
filtering is proposed to improve the local estimate. This allows the
final reconstruction to be performed at the structural level as opposed
to the pixel level. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed local directional interpolation and nonlocal adaptive thresholding
method outperforms many state-of-the-art CDM methods in
reconstructing the edges and reducing color interpolation artifacts,

In this paper, we study a classical demosaicking algorithm based on alternating projections (AP), proposed by Gunturk, Altunbasak and Mersereau in 2002. Since its publication, the AP algorithm has been widely cited and served as a benchmark in a series of more recent papers in the demosaicking literature. Despite impressive performances, a limitation of the AP algorithm is its high computational complexity. We provide three main contributions in this paper. First, we present a rigorous analysis of the convergence property of the AP demosaicking algorithm, showing that it is a contraction mapping, with a unique fixed point. Second, we show that this fixed point is in fact the solution to a constrained quadratic minimization problem, thus establishing the optimality of the AP algorithm. Finally, using the tool of polyphase representation, we show how to obtain the results of the AP algorithm in a single step, implemented as linear filtering in the polyphase domain. Replacing the original iterative procedure by the proposed one-step solution leads to substantial computational savings, by about an order of magnitude in our experiments}

On the other hand, explicitly exploiting the self-similarities of natural images has led to the successful non-local means approach to image restoration. We propose simultaneous sparse coding as a framework for combining these two approaches in a natural manner. This is achieved by jointly decomposing groups of similar signals on subsets of the learned dictionary. Experimental results in image denoising and demosaicking tasks with synthetic and real noise show that the proposed method outperforms the state of the art, making it possible to effectively restore raw images from digital cameras at a reasonable speed and memory cost.}

In all demosaicking techniques, the interpolation of the green components plays a central role in dictating the visual quality of reconstructed images because green light is of maximum sensitivity in the human visual system. Guided by this point, we propose a new soft-decision demosaicking algorithm using directional filtering and embedded artifact refinement. The novelty of this approach is twofold. First, we lift the constraint of the Bayer CFA that results in the absence of diagonal neighboring green color values for directionally recovering diagonal edges. The developed directional interpolation method is fairly robust in dealing with the four edge features, namely, vertical, horizontal, 45-deg diagonal, and 135-deg diagonal. In addition, the proposed embedded refinement scheme provides an efficient way for soft-decision-based algorithms to achieve improved results with fewer computations. We have compared this new approach to six state-of-the-art methods, and it can outstandingly preserve more edge details and handle fine textures well, without requiring a high computational cost.}

They exploit spectral correlations between the primary color bands to interpolate the missing color samples, but in areas of no or weak spectral correlations, these algorithms are prone to large interpolation errors. Such demosaicking errors are visually objectionable because they tend to correlate with object boundaries and edges. This paper proposes a remedy to the above problem that has long been overlooked in the literature. The main contribution of this work is a hybrid demosaicking approach that supplements an existing color demosaicking algorithm by combining its results with those of adaptive intraband interpolation. This is formulated as an optimal data fusion problem, and two solutions are proposed: one is based on linear minimum mean-square estimation and the other based on support vector regression. Experimental results demonstrate that the new hybrid approach is more robust and eliminates the worst type of color artifacts of existing color demosaicking methods.}

Owing to the growing ubiquity of color imaging and display devices, much recent work has focused on the implications of such arrays for subsequent digital processing, including in particular the canonical demosaicking task of reconstructing a full color image from spatially subsampled and incomplete color data acquired under a particular choice of array pattern. In contrast to the majority of the demosaicking literature, we consider here the problem of color filter array design and its implications for spatial reconstruction quality. We pose this problem formally as one of simultaneously maximizing the spectral radii of luminance and chrominance channels subject to perfect reconstruction, and - after proving sub-optimality of a wide class of existing array patterns - provide a constructive method for its solution that yields robust, new panchromatic designs implementable as subtractive colors. Empirical evaluations on multiple color image test sets support our theoretical results, and indicate the potential of these patterns to increase spatial resolution for fixed sensor size, and to contribute to improved reconstruction fidelity as well as significantly reduced hardware complexity.}

We present two main contributions to CFA demosaicking. First, we analyze the causes of two main types of CFA demosaicking artifacts and examine the schemes that are effective in suppressing them, respectively. Second, by combining and extending the core merits of the schemes examined, we compose a new CFA demosaicking algorithm to suppress as many demosaicking artifacts as possible and obtain fullcolor images of high quality. Experiments using a large variety of test images have been conducted, and the results show that the proposed method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods both visually and in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio

  abstract =     {The problem of recovering full-color images from a noisy and color-sampled observation is considered in this paper. The noise in imaging sensors corrupts the color filter array (CFA) and introduces artifacts during the color interpolation step. Instead of filtering the noise before or after the color interpolation step, we remove the noise during the color interpolation step. This allows us to obtain a color interpolated image without noise and artifacts especially along the edges and in the detail of the image. Color interpolation is carried out on the weighted color difference domain to consider cross-channel correlation. In order to avoid artifacts in high frequency regions and improve the performance, an edge indicator function is used and directions of edges are considered in the proposed interpolation method. Interpolation artifacts are removed by the modified filtering on color difference domain. Experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.}

1. Les cam\'eras mono-CCD bas\'ees sur un CFA \'echantillonnent 1 seule composante couleur par position spatiale, comme le SVH dans lequel les 3 types de c\^ones sont sensibles \`a des longueurs d'ondes diff\'erentes. On a d\'ecouvert qu'une image \`a 1 composante par pixel peut \^etre interpr\'et\'ee comme la repr\'esentation d'une image dont la luminance et la chrominance ont des positions bien distinctes dans le domaine de Fourier.
2. Pour reconstruire le signal original, on devrait utiliser une fonction sinc; en pratique, on utilise une approximation de cette fonction id\'eale. L'interpolation la plus simple - bilin\'eaire - ne permet de reconstruire l'image sans artefact d'aliasing que si la fr\'equence maximale dans chaque canal ne d\'epasse pas la moiti\'e de la fr\'equence d'\'echantillonnage.
3. La repr\'esentation d'une image couleur en luminance et couleurs oppos\'ees correspond mieux \`a la perception humaine que l'encodage RGB des couleurs. Une image couleur peut \^etre repr\'esent\'ee comme la somme d'un scalaire repr\'esentant la luminance et d'un vecteur de 3 couleurs oppos\'ees (chrominance). L'image CFA, pour sa part, peut \^etre exprim\'ee comme la somme d'une luminance scalaire et d'une chrominance scalaire. La luminance est exactement pr\'esente dans une image CFA, mï¿½me si elle est sujette \`a l'aliasing avec la chrominance. La luminance et la chrominance dans une image CFA ont des positions sp\'ecifiques dans le plan de Fourier : la zone de basses fr\'equences correspond \`a la luminance et celles de hautes fr\'equences \`a la chrominance. Chacune peut \^etre estim\'ee par filtrage fr\'equentiel (passe-bas et passe-haut). Lorsque les spectres de la luminance et de la chrominance se recouvrent, les algos de d\'ematri\c{c}age reconstruisent l'information de luminance dans la chrominance (et vice-versa), r\'esultant en des artefacts visuels. Ce sont surtout i) du flou si le filtrage de la luminance est trop \'etroit (sous-estim\'ee) et ii) des fausses couleurs si le filtrage de la chrominance est trop large (sur-estim\'ee); mais aussi parfois iii) un effet de grille si le filtrage de la luminance inclut trop de chrominance et iv) une "couleur d'eau" si le filtrage de la chrominance est trop \'etroit.},

  abstract =     {There is an analogy between single-chip color cameras and the human visual system in that these two systems acquire only one limited wavelength sensitivity band per spatial location. We have exploited this analogy, defining a model that characterizes a one-color per spatial position image as a coding into luminance and chrominance of the corresponding three-colors per spatial position image. Luminance is defined with full spatial resolution while chrominance contains sub-sampled opponent colors. Moreover, luminance and chrominance follow a particular
arrangement in the Fourier domain, allowing for demosaicing by spatial frequency filtering. This model shows that visual artifacts after demosaicing are due to aliasing between luminance and chrominance and could be solved using a pre -processing filter. This approach also gives new insights for the representation of single-color per spatial location images and enables formal and controllable procedures to design demosaicing algorithms that perform well compared to concurrent approaches, as demonstrated by experiments.},

  abstract =     {Single-sensor digital color cameras use a process called color demosaicking to produce full color images from the data captured by a color filter array (CFA). The quality of demosaicked images is degraded due to the sensor noise introduced during the image acquisition process. The conventional solution to combating CFA sensor noise is demosaicking first, followed by a separate denoising processing. This strategy will generate many noise-caused color artifacts in the demosaicking process, which are hard to remove in the denoising process. Few denoising schemes that work directly on the CFA images have been presented because of the difficulties arisen from the red, green and blue interlaced mosaic pattern, yet a well designed ldquodenoising first and demosaicking laterrdquo scheme can have advantages such as less noise-caused color artifacts and cost-effective implementation. This paper presents a principle component analysis (PCA) based spatially-adaptive denoising algorithm, which works directly on the CFA data using a supporting window to analyze the local image statistics. By exploiting the spatial and spectral correlations existed in the CFA image, the proposed method can effectively suppress noise while preserving color edges and details. Experiments using both simulated and real CFA images indicate that the proposed scheme outperforms many existing approaches, including those sophisticated demosaicking and denoising schemes, in terms of both objective measurement and visual evaluation.},

  abstract =     {The development and tuning of denoising algorithms is usually based on readily processed test images that are artificially degraded with additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). While AWGN allows us to easily generate test data in a repeatable manner, it does not reflect the noise characteristics in a real digital camera. Realistic camera noise is signal-dependent and spatially correlated due to the demosaicking step required to obtain full-color images. Hence, the noise characteristic is fundamentally different from AWGN. Using such unrealistic data to test, optimize and compare denoising algorithms may lead to incorrect parameter tuning or sub optimal choices in research on denoising algorithms. In this paper, we therefore propose an approach to evaluate denoising algorithms with respect to realistic camera noise: we describe a new camera noise model that includes the full processing chain of a single sensor camera. We determine the visual quality of noisy and denoised test sequences using a subjective test with 18 participants. We show that the noise characteristics have a significant effect on visual quality. Quality metrics, which are required to compare denoising results, are applied, and we evaluate the performance of 10 full-reference metrics and one no-reference metric with our realistic test data. We conclude that a more realistic noise model should be used in future research to improve the quality estimation of digital images and videos and to improve the research on denoising algorithms.}

The results indicate that this technique offers a better reconstruction performance (in PSNR sense and visually) than sequential demosaicing and denoising.

To facilitate an objective assessment of current methods, we introduce a public ground truth data set of natural images suitable for research in image demosaicing and denoising. We then use this large data set to develop a machine learning approach to demosaicing. Our proposed method addresses both demosaicing challenges by learning a statistical model of images and noise from hundreds of natural images. The resulting model performs simultaneous demosaicing and denoising. We show that the machine learning approach has a number of benefits: 1) the model is trained to directly optimize a user-specified performance measure such as peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) or structural similarity; 2) we can handle novel color filter array layouts by retraining the model on such layouts; and 3) it outperforms the previous state-of-the-art, in some setups by 0.7-dB PSNR, faithfully reconstructing edges, textures, and smooth areas. Our results demonstrate that in demosaicing and related imaging applications, discriminatively trained machine learning models have the potential for peak performance at comparatively low engineering effort.},

  abstract =     {Typical digital cameras use a single-chip image sensor covered with a mosaic of red, green, and blue color filters for capturing color information. At each pixel location, only one of the three color values is known. The interpolation of the two missing color values at each pixel in a color filter array image (CFA) is called demosaicing. In this paper, we propose a novel training-based approach for computing the missing green pixels in a CFA. The algorithm works by extracting a multi-dimensional feature vector comprising derivatives of various orders computed in a spatial neighborhood of the pixel being interpolated. Using a statistical machine learning framework, the feature vector is then used to predict the optimal interpolation direction for estimating the missing green pixel. The parameters of the statistical model are learned in an offline training procedure using example training images. Once the green channel has been estimated, the red and blue pixels are estimated using bilinear interpolation of the difference (chrominance) channels. Both subjective and objective evaluations show that the proposed demosaic algorithm yields a high output image quality. The algorithm is computationally and memory efficient, and its sequential architecture makes it easy to implement in an imaging system.}

  abstract =     {Image demosaicing is a problem of interpolating full-resolution color images from so-called color-filter-array (CFA) samples. Among various CFA patterns, Bayer pattern has been the most popular choice and demosaicing of Bayer pattern has attracted renewed interest in recent years partially due to the increased availability of source codes/executables in response to the principle of "reproducible research". In this article, we provide a systematic survey of over seventy published works in this field since 1999 (complementary to previous reviews). Our review attempts to address important issues to demosaicing and identify fundamental differences among competing approaches. Our findings suggest most existing works belong to the class of sequential demosaicing - i.e., luminance channel is interpolated first and then chrominance channels are reconstructed based on recovered luminance information. We report our comparative study results with a collection of eleven competing algorithms whose source codes or executables are provided by the authors. Our comparison is performed on two data sets: Kodak PhotoCD (popular choice) and IMAX high-quality images (more challenging). While most existing demosaicing algorithms achieve good performance on the Kodak data set, their performance on the IMAX one (images with varying-hue and high-saturation edges) degrades significantly. Such observation suggests the importance of properly addressing the issue of mismatch between assumed model and observation data in demosaicing, which calls for further investigation on issues such as model validation, test data selection and performance evaluation.}

The guided filter can be used as an edge-preserving smoothing operator like the popular bilateral filter [1], but it has better behaviors near edges. The guided filter is also a more generic concept beyond smoothing: It can transfer the structures of the guidance image to the filtering output, enabling new filtering applications like dehazing and guided feathering. Moreover, the guided filter naturally has a fast and nonapproximate linear time algorithm, regardless of the kernel size and the intensity range. Currently, it is one of the fastest edge-preserving filters. Experiments show that the guided filter is both effective and efficient in a great variety of computer vision and computer graphics applications, including edge-aware smoothing, detail enhancement, HDR compression, image matting/feathering, dehazing, joint upsampling, etc.}

  abstract =     {A recently developed demosaicing methodology, called residual interpolation (RI), has demonstrated superior performance over the conventional color-component difference interpolation. However, it has been observed that the existing RI-based methods fail to fully exploit the potential of RI strategy on the reconstruction of the most important G channel, as only the R and B channels are restored through the RI strategy. Since any reconstruction error introduced in the G channel will be carried over into the demosaicing process of the other two channels, this makes the restoration of the G channel highly instrumental to the quality of the final demosaiced image. In this paper, a novel iterative RI (IRI) process is developed for reconstructing a highly accurate G channel first; in essence, it can be viewed as an iterative refinement process for the estimation of those missing pixel values on the G channel. The key novelty of the proposed IRI process is that all the three channels will mutually guide each other until a stopping criterion is met. Based on the restored G channel, the mosaiced R and B channels will be, respectively, reconstructed by exploiting the existing RI method without iteration. Extensive simulations conducted on two commonly-used test datasets for demosaicing algorithms have demonstrated that our algorithm has achieved the best performance in most cases, compared with the existing state-of-the-art demosaicing methods on both objective and subjective performance evaluations.},

Given sensed samples of an image, CD employs a CS solver to find the sparse representation of that image under a fixed sparsifying dictionary \Ψ. As opposed to state of the art CS-based demosaicing approaches, we consider a clear distinction between the interchannel (color) and interpixel correlations of natural images. Utilizing some well-known facts about the human visual system, those two types of correlations are utilized in a nonseparable format to construct the sparsifying transform \Ψ.

1. L'approche du dématriçage dans le domaine fréquentiel laisse entrevoir des perspectives très intéressantes. Même si la diaphonie des composantes est inévitable, le démultiplexage du signal CFA doit exploiter les corrélations pour obtenir la meilleure qualité de reconstruction possible.
2. Le signal CFA peut s'exprimer comme la somme d'une composante de luminance en bande de base, et de 2 composantes de chrominance, l'une modulée à la fréquence spatiale (0.5,0.5) et l'autre aux fréquences (0.5,0) et (0,0.5) (en cycles/pixels).
3. Il est possible de réduire l'interférence entre la luminance L et la composante modulée C2 en observant qu'il y a DEUX copies bien séparées de cette dernière dans le spectre d'une image, chacune ayant un chevauchement spectral différent avec la composante de luminance. L'auteur propose donc 2 algos de dématriçage A) utilisant des filtres asymétriques complémentaires pour extraire les 2 composantes de C2 modulées à des fréquences différentes, ce qui permet de reconstruire C2. La luminance est alors estimée comme "L=CFA-C1-C2", puis les composantes R,G,B par inversion de la matrice donnant (L,C1,C2)=f(R,G,B); et B) de pondérer adaptativement chacune des composantes de C2, en fonction du voisinage local, de façon à favoriser celle qui présente le chevauchement minimal avec la luminance.},

The success of the approach depends on the definition of a comprehensive set of goals for the computation of edge points. These goals must be precise enough to delimit the desired behavior of the detector while making minimal assumptions about the form of the solution. We define detection and localization criteria for a class of edges, and present mathematical forms for these criteria as functionals on the operator impulse response. A third criterion is then added to ensure that the detector has only one response to a single edge. We use the criteria in numerical optimization to derive detectors for several common image features, including step edges. On specializing the analysis to step edges, we find that there is a natural uncertainty principle between detection and localization performance, which are the two main goals. With this principle we derive a single operator shape which is optimal at any scale. The optimal detector has a simple approximate implementation in which edges are marked at maxima in gradient magnitude of a Gaussian-smoothed image. We extend this simple detector using operators of several widths to cope with different signal-to-noise ratios in the image. We present a general method, called feature synthesis, for the fine-to-coarse integration of information from operators at different scales. Finally we show that step edge detector performance improves considerably as the operator point spread function is extended along the edge.}

  abstract =     {A highly efficient recursive algorithm for edge detection is presented. Using Canny's design [1], we show that a solution to his precise formulation of detection and localization for an infinite extent filter leads to an optimal operator in one dimension, which can be efficiently implemented by two recursive filters moving in opposite directions. In addition to the noise truncature immunity which results, the recursive nature of the filtering operations leads, with sequential machines, to a substantial saving in computational effort (five multiplications and five additions for one pixel, independent of the size of the neighborhood). The extension to the two-dimensional case is considered and the resulting filtering structures are implemented as two-dimensional recursive filters. Hence, the filter size can be varied by simply changing the value of one parameter without affecting the time execution of the algorithm. Performance measures of this new edge detector are given and compared to Canny's filters. Various experimental results are shown.}

  abstract =     {Single sensor digital color still/video cameras capture images using a color filter array (CFA) and require color interpolation (demosaicking) to reconstruct full color images. The color reproduction has to combat sensor noises which are channel dependent. If untreated in demosaicking, sensor noises can cause color artifacts that are hard to remove later by a separate denoising process, because the demosaicking process complicates the noise characteristics by blending noises of different color channels. This paper presents a joint demosaicking-denoising approach to overcome this difficulty. The color image is restored from noisy mosaic data in two steps. First, the difference signals of color channels are estimated by linear minimum mean square-error estimation. This process exploits both spectral and spatial correlations to simultaneously suppress sensor noise and interpolation error. With the estimated difference signals, the full resolution green channel is recovered. The second step involves in a wavelet-based denoising process to remove the CFA channel-dependent noises from the reconstructed green channel. The red and blue channels are subsequently recovered. Simulated and real CFA mosaic data are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed joint demosaicking-denoising scheme and compare it with many recently developed sophisticated demosaicking and denoising schemes.},

number of multiplications and additions per output point independently
of the size of the neighborhood considered. The key to our approach
is first the use of an exponentially based filter family and second
the use of the recursive filtering. Applications to edge detection problems

detector allowing the extraction of zero-crossings of an image with only
14 operations per output element at any resolution is proposed. Various
